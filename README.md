# Alicia-s-Picture-Organizer
Ok. I've spent HOURS and HOURS on this so I hope it does what you want. I wrote a program that will organize your pictures for you. 
It uses the date stored on the picture to decide how to organize it. I spent 2 days alone just trying to figure out how to make the folders 3 letters instead of 2 digit. 
Anyway, it will put the year first, followed by the 3 letter month in a folder. I can configure it to name them however you want. It doesn't erase any. Any that don't have 
a date or confuses the program get stored in a seperate folder. At that point, you do have to manually put them where you want. it's usually scans and screenshots like that though.
It is your program so tell me how you want it and I will make it happen (other than the icon of my face. That's custom). As I get better and learn more, we can refine "THE ALICIA PROJECT" 
I love you very much and I hope this can take some of your anxieties away this year. Merry XMAS 2018.
